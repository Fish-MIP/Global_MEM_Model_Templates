**Spatial scale forcing**

Global at 1/2 and 1 degree

**Levels of gear disaggregation**

Can be disaggregated based on the Sea Around Us gear division

**Levels of functional group disaggregation**

Runs at the species level

**Spatial grid-cell allocation method**

Fishing level based on an estimated unfished abundance that is fished at F = Fmsy rate.

**Fishing mortality rate equation**

The global unfished biomass of the population is estimated based on the average of the top-10 annual catches by weight of the modelled species in the world from 1950 -- 2010 and their intrinsic population growth rate. Assuming logistic population growth, unfished biomass (Bunfished) of a population was estimated:

Bunfished = 4\*MSY/r

The DBEM assumes that the average of the top-10 annual (historical) catches was roughly equal to the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) of a species.

**Selectivity (size,age,species)**

[If you have a selectivity term please describe it, with equation]

**Model calibration**

[Catchability terms can be used to calibrate the model to catches, using data ONLY UP TO 2004. Please state how you estimate these parameters and the metrics and criteria you use to calibrate your model. Please provide details and equations]

N/A\

**Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates**

[Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary]

N/A

**Further details on calibration**

[Have you used other metrics or data in your calibration?]

N/A

**Statistical metrics**

[Please provide detail on the statistical method used in your calibration - E.g. optimisation, error terms]

**Statistical results (summary)**

[Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration - E.g. RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P"B ratios etc]

**Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration**

[Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration]

**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:**

**Downscaling method**

[Please describe further details how the LME level fishing effort was downscaled to your region, providing further information on what data, if any were used, E.g. ]

N/A

**The "base" year range of the regional model**

[If you expressed effort relative to the effort in your base model, which year was the base year and how was this done]
