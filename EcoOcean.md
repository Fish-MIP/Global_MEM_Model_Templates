**Spatial grid-cell allocation method**

Simple fishing effort gravity model based on cost/benefit analysis

**Fishing mortality rate equation**

[How are fishing mortality and catch rates calculated in your model? Please provide equations as well as description]

N/A

**Selectivity (size,age,species)**

[If you have a selectivity term please describe it, with equation]

N/A

**Model calibration**

[Catchability terms can be used to calibrate the model to catches, using data ONLY UP TO 2004. Please state how you estimate these parameters and the metrics and criteria you use to calibrate your model. Please provide details and equations]

N/A

**Catchability and Creep (yearly rate of change catchability) Estimates**

[Please provide details on the specific estimated parameters from the calibration, e.g. range of creep of 2-5% per year; and catchability coefficients per gear / functional group as necessary]

N/A

**Further details on calibration**

[Have you used other metrics or data in your calibration?]

N/A\
**Statistical metrics**

[Please provide detail on the statistical method used in your calibration - E.g. optimisation, error terms]

N/A

**Statistical results (summary)**

[Please provide a summary of the metrics and results associated with your model calibration - E.g. RMSE with observed catches and any other process-based or theoretical criteria used to calibrate the model, comparison of modelled biomass, growth rates, P"B ratios etc]

N/A\
**Model changes or  improvements(s) made as a result of calibration**

[Please provide detail of any other parameters or model changes since the last round as a result of this calibration]

N/A\
**ADDITIONAL DETAILS FOR REGIONAL MODELS ONLY:**

**Downscaling method**

[Please describe further details how the LME level fishing effort was downscaled to your region, providing further information on what data, if any were used, E.g. ]

N/A\
**The "base" year range of the regional model**

[If you expressed effort relative to the effort in your base model, which year was the base year and how was this done]
