# Model ecology overview
APECOSM model (Apex Predators ECOSystem Model) aims to represent the spatialized dynamics of open ocean pelagic ecosystems in the global ocean. Physical forcings (winds, temperature and currents), biogeochemical forcings (primary production, light and oxygen) as well as the effects of fishing are explicitely taken into account in the model. The model represents the energy flow through the Open Ocean Pelagic Ecosystem (OOPE) with a size-structured energy flux equation in 5 explicit dimensions (space, time, community and weight).
